# WWDC-A2

Hi, my name is Kathy Doan and I have created a mini game using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade. 

**General Information** 

I chose to design a simple arcade game to demonstrate how it is possible to start coding a game as a beginner game developer for my assignment.

I have designed a mini arcade game of a monkey trying to collect coins and reach its banana successfully by not falling into the swamp water.

**Technologies Used**

- Laptop/PC
- Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

**Project Status**

Completed as part of my Working with Data and Code A2. 

**Room for Improvement**

Things I believe I can improve on for this project is being more creative in the way I design and adding more features.
